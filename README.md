# Job-Post-Checker

This Python script is a work in progress and is designed to automate the process of scraping job postings from the Home Depot career page. Using the Selenium library, the script navigates to the Home Depot career page, searches for job postings with the title "Data Analyst", and extracts and returns the titles of these postings. Please note that this script is currently a work in progress and does not function as intended yet. Further adjustments and improvements are required for it to function correctly and efficiently.
